# Fall Guys Protobuf Extractor

This repository is an example of how to use the .NET type model generated by [Il2CppInspector](https://github.com/djkaty/Il2CppInspector) in your own programs to query the code and data of an IL2CPP application.

This example queries the Steam game [Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/) and generates a `.proto` file for the login and lobby/matchmaking servers.

**Tutorial coming soon!**
